## Hang In There™

Hang In There™ is a revolutionary motivational website that alters the stream of images accessed by your eyeballs in order to create a net-positive increase in mood.

We discovered after years of research that when adorable photos are combined with short-cheesy motivational phrases in random rapid succession, the mood of the one perceiving said images increases exponentially.  We developed this web platform as a way of harnessing the power of this phenomenon.  

When the patient accesses the webpage, a random motivational image is generated from a database of images, titles, and quotes which we have pre-tested for maximum effectiveness.  This constitutes the patient's first dose of mood-boosting image-title-quote combinations.  

We have given the patient the option to self-administer the doses of image-title-quote combinations.  With each press of the button titled "Show Another Random Poster", the patient is shown a new random image-title-quote combination.  The patient is free to hit this button at whatever speed of dose administration they are comfortable with.

In our research, we've determined that some image-title-quote combinations leave a lasting impression on the patient and, therefore, there repeated use is desirable.  For this reason, we have also given the user the option to save combinations they find particularly meaningful by means of the "Save This Poster" button.  

If the patient wants to view any of the combinations that they have saved, they can do so by clicking the "Show Saved Posters" button.  This will take them to a page where all of their saved posters are available on a predefined nirvana-grid™.  If for any reason, the patient suddenly has a traumatic flashback triggered by any image, they have been given the option to abort the image from their nirvana-grid with the effortless click of the image, itself.

Finally, if the patient is feeling particularly liberated by their experience using Hang-in-There™, they have the option to take control of the image stream by creating their own image combinations.  When the patient is ready to do so, they can press the "Make Your Own Poster" button on the main page.  This will take them to the maximum-liberation-zone™.  Here they can input an image found on the web, a quote, and title of their choosing, and then with one simple click of the "Show my poster" button, the positive image conceived in their mind will be fully manifested on the original title page.

In Summary, this website has been shown to universally boost the moods of individuals of all background and walks of life.  With it, our organization will quite literally raise the mood of all humanity.  When you're ready to revolutionize your mood, and life itself, execute the deploy link below.  Thank you.
